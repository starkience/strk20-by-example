# Cairo example contracts

Cairo sources for the example pages, mirrored into `src/pages/` by
`npm run copy:contracts`.

## Provenance

These contracts are adapted from the
[starknet-privacy](https://github.com/starkware-libs/starknet-privacy) monorepo
(Apache License 2.0, StarkWare):

| Example | Upstream source |
| --- | --- |
| `src/helpers/privacy-invoke/EchoHelper.cairo` | `packages/privacy/src/tests/mock_invoke_returns.cairo` |
| `src/helpers/swap-helper/SwapHelper.cairo` | `packages/privacy/src/test_contracts/mock_swap_executor.cairo` |
| `src/helpers/swap-helper/MockAmm.cairo` | `packages/privacy/src/test_contracts/mock_amm.cairo` |
| `src/helpers/vesu-lending-helper/VesuLendingHelper.cairo` | `packages/vesu_lending_helper/src/vesu_lending_helper.cairo` |
| `src/helpers/escrow/Escrow.cairo` | `packages/escrow/src/escrow.cairo` |

Adaptations are limited to: trimming module-level doc comments that live in the
example page prose instead, renaming mock contracts to tutorial names, and
removing test-only entry points. The code is otherwise kept verbatim so it stays
diffable against upstream.

## Compilation

These files are **not compiled standalone in v1**: page slugs are kebab-case
(not valid Cairo module names) and the helpers depend on the privacy pool
package (`privacy::objects::OpenNoteDeposit`). All of them are adapted from
code that compiles and is tested in the upstream monorepo — compile
verification happens there.
