# STRK20 by Example

Learn Starknet Privacy (STRK20) with simple examples - privacy pools, notes and
nullifiers, viewing keys, the Starknet Wallet API, Cairo anonymizer contracts, and wallet-builder SDK flows.

### Development

```shell
npm i
npm start
```

### Production

```shell
npm run build
# Preview production
npm run preview
```

### Authoring a page

1. Cairo pages only: put the contract in `contracts/src/<category>/<slug>/Name.cairo`,
   then mirror it into `src/pages/`:

   ```shell
   npm run copy:contracts
   ```

2. Write `src/pages/<category>/<slug>/index.md` with frontmatter
   (`title`, `version`, `description`, `keywords`, optional `githubLink`).
   Inject Cairo sources with Mustache placeholders inside a fence:

   ````markdown
   ```cairo
   {{{Name}}}
   ```
   ````

   TypeScript SDK snippets are written inline in ```typescript fences
   (do NOT add `.ts` files under `src/pages/` - they'd be typechecked by the app build).

3. Generate the page (or all pages):

   ```shell
   npm run page src/pages/<category>/<slug>
   npm run pages:all
   ```

4. Register the route in `src/nav.ts` (correct array + position = prev/next order),
   then regenerate routes and the search index:

   ```shell
   npm run routes
   npm run search
   ```

5. `npm start` and eyeball it.

Note: after ANY change to `scripts/md-to-react.ts`, the mustache templates, or
highlighting, run `npm run pages:all` - highlighted HTML is frozen into
`index.html.ts` at generation time.

### Contracts

`contracts/` holds the Cairo sources for example pages, adapted from the
starknet-privacy monorepo. They are not compiled standalone in v1 - see
`contracts/README.md`.

### Hosting under /docs

Set `VITE_PUBLIC_URL=/docs` and `SITE_URL=https://strk20.starknet.io/docs`
when building the documentation hosting project. Output is nested under
`build/docs`; the website proxies `/docs` and `/docs/:path*` to that project.
Leave these variables unset to build the standalone documentation site.

The build regenerates client routes after generating pages. Its verification
checks navigation route coverage, internal links, and raw Markdown mirrors.
