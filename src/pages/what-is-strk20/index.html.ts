const html = `<p>The foundation for all privacy on Starknet: the layer everything above reads from
and writes to. STRK20 brings shielded balances, private transfers, and private
DeFi to any ERC-20 on Starknet, built on the wallets and liquidity that already
exist rather than a separate ecosystem.</p>
<h3>How it works at a high level</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Note-based pool: not a mixer.</strong> Shielding deposits an ERC-20 into the pool,
where the balance is held as an encrypted note (a UTXO). Private transfers
spend existing notes and generate new ones.</li>
<li><strong>Registration first:</strong> An account must register in the pool (set a viewing key)
before it can hold or receive private balances; both sender and recipient must
be registered before private transfers between them. Wallets handle registration
on first use, and channel setup between counterparties is automatic after that.</li>
<li><strong>Onchain proof verification:</strong> Every private transaction carries a
zero-knowledge (STARK) proof confirming the spent notes exist, belong to the
spender, haven&#39;t been double-spent, and that value is conserved. Starknet
verifies the proof in-protocol before updating the pool&#39;s state.</li>
<li><strong>Hidden vs. visible:</strong> Inside the pool, the sender, receiver, amounts, token
type, and which notes were spent are all private. What stays visible: deposit
and withdrawal amounts (the public ERC-20 legs), that someone is interacting
with the pool, and timing. A Paymaster can decouple the submitter&#39;s address
from the transaction.</li>
<li><strong>Shielding:</strong> Users shield assets when they want privacy and unshield them when
transparency is required, moving value between public and confidential states on
the same underlying token.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The lifecycle: public → private → public</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Deposit</strong> - move public ERC-20 tokens into the pool. The deposit itself is
visible on-chain (depositor and amount), but the resulting note is encrypted.</li>
<li><strong>Private transfers</strong> - transfer value inside the pool by spending notes and
creating new ones. Nobody watching the chain can tell who paid whom, or how much.</li>
<li><strong>DeFi</strong> - if your flow calls for it, notes can fund DeFi actions through an
anonymizer contract, with results credited back as private notes. This leg
is confidential rather than fully private: the link to the user is hidden,
but the app-side action and amounts can still be public.</li>
<li><strong>Withdraw</strong> - move tokens back out of the pool to a public address.</li>
</ol>
<p>Upcoming <strong>private sub-accounts</strong> (coming soon) will widen the DeFi leg:
account-based flows such as borrowing and staking will run through real
Starknet accounts that carry no public onchain link back to the user&#39;s main
wallet, and using fresh sub-accounts per app fragments the trail further. The
same caveat applies - app-side activity and amounts can still be public.</p>
<h2>What makes it different</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Native to Starknet</strong> - no separate chain or bridge. It runs as a contract on
Starknet and composes with existing accounts and DeFi.</li>
<li><strong>Variable amounts, reusable notes</strong> - unlike fixed-denomination mixers, notes
carry arbitrary amounts and change is handled automatically.</li>
<li><strong>Scalable discovery</strong> - recipients find their incoming funds by scanning only
their own channels, so cost scales with your activity, not total pool volume.</li>
<li><strong>Selective disclosure</strong> - at registration every user encrypts their private
viewing key to an auditor&#39;s public key, so the system can disclose the
information needed to respond to a legitimate regulatory request without
exposing unrelated users.</li>
</ul>
