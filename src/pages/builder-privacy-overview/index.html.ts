<h2 id="core-surfaces">Core surfaces</h2>
<h3 id="strk20-pool">STRK20 pool</h3>
<p>The pool is the base contract layer. Deposits move public ERC-20 tokens into the
pool, private transfers spend encrypted notes inside the pool, and withdrawals
move tokens back to a public address. Movement inside the pool hides sender,
receiver, token, amount, and spent notes from public observers.</p>
<h3 id="starknet-wallet-api">Starknet Wallet API</h3>
<p>This is the recommended route for most <strong>private dapps</strong>. Your dapp asks the
user&#39;s privacy-enabled wallet to perform an action; the wallet handles private
state, proofs, and submission. A normal dapp should not receive the user&#39;s
viewing key or manage note discovery directly. See the
<a href="/starknet-wallet-api/overview">Starknet Wallet API overview</a>.</p>
<h3 id="anonymizer-contracts">Anonymizer contracts</h3>
<p>Anonymizer contracts, also called helper contracts, are app-specific Cairo
adapters for private DeFi. The pool withdraws tokens to the helper, calls its
<code>privacy_invoke</code> entry point, and the helper returns <code>OpenNoteDeposit</code>
instructions for whatever should be credited back into private notes. This is the
focus for <strong>core builders shipping private dapps</strong>. See
<a href="/helpers/privacy-invoke">Anonymizer Contract Anatomy</a>.</p>
<h3 id="build-privacy-wallets">Build Privacy Wallets</h3>
<p>The Build Privacy Wallets section is the lower-level SDK route for teams building
<strong>privacy wallets on Starknet</strong>, account-controlled backends, and advanced
integrators. Use it when you need to
manage registration, channels, note discovery, transaction construction, and
proving providers yourself. See <a href="/sdk/getting-started">Build Privacy Wallets</a>.</p>
<h3 id="private-sub-accounts-coming-soon">Private sub-accounts (coming soon)</h3>
<p>Private sub-accounts are for account-based app activity where the user does not
want a public onchain link to their main wallet. Treat this as an advanced route:
confirm wallet, SDK, API, and audit readiness before building a production flow
around it.</p>
<h3 id="prover-backend">Prover backend</h3>
<p>Most dapps do not need to operate proving infrastructure. Wallets,
infrastructure teams, and advanced integrators may run their own prover when
they need operational control over proof generation. Deposit screening applies
regardless of proving route: FPI screens shielding addresses and signs each
deposit, and the pool verifies the signature onchain, so a self-hosted prover
meets the same deposit-screening requirement as hosted services.</p>
<h2 id="builder-rules-of-thumb">Builder rules of thumb</h2>
<ul>
<li>Use the Starknet Wallet API first for user-facing private dapps.</li>
<li>Use Build Privacy Wallets when you are building the wallet itself or need low-level SDK control.</li>
<li>Do not ask a normal dapp user for their viewing key.</li>
<li>For private DeFi integrations, expect both a Starknet Wallet API flow and an app-specific anonymizer contract.</li>
<li>Deposits are screened on every route - self-hosted proving does not bypass onchain screening.</li>
<li>Be explicit about what remains public: deposits, withdrawals, timing, and some app-side activity may still be visible.</li>
<li>Verify wallet support, API versions, contract addresses, and compliance assumptions before launch.</li>
</ul>
