STRK20 is a privacy pool plus a small set of integration surfaces. Start with
the narrowest surface that keeps user keys in the right place and only move to a
lower-level route when your product needs more control.

## Core surfaces

### STRK20 pool

The pool is the base contract layer. Deposits move public ERC-20 tokens into the
pool, private transfers spend encrypted notes inside the pool, and withdrawals
move tokens back to a public address. Movement inside the pool hides sender,
receiver, token, amount, and spent notes from public observers.

### Starknet Wallet API

This is the recommended route for most **private dapps**. Your dapp asks the
user's privacy-enabled wallet to perform an action; the wallet handles private
state, proofs, and submission. A normal dapp should not receive the user's
viewing key or manage note discovery directly. See the
[Starknet Wallet API overview](/starknet-wallet-api/overview).

### Anonymizer contracts

Anonymizer contracts, also called helper contracts, are app-specific Cairo
adapters for private DeFi. The pool withdraws tokens to the helper, calls its
`privacy_invoke` entry point, and the helper returns `OpenNoteDeposit`
instructions for whatever should be credited back into private notes. This is the
focus for **core builders shipping private dapps**. See
[Anonymizer Contract Anatomy](/helpers/privacy-invoke).

### Privacy Bridge (EVM to pool)

Most users hold their USDC on an EVM chain, not on Starknet. The
[Privacy Bridge](https://github.com/starkware-libs/privacy-bridge) is a
value-movement engine for exactly that gap: it takes USDC from an EVM wallet and
deposits it into the pool as a private note, and moves value back out to an EVM
chain, using Circle's CCTP for the cross-chain leg. Both directions run through
its own Cairo anonymizer contracts - `OutboundAnonymizer` on the way out,
`InboundAnonymizer` on the way back in - so the deposit side and the withdrawal
side cannot be linked onchain. All client-side key material is derived from a
single wallet signature; only the read-only viewing key may be persisted.

The repository is open source (Apache 2.0) and ships three parts: the
`bridge-anonymizers` Cairo contracts, the framework-agnostic
`@starkware-libs/starknet-privacy-bridge` TypeScript engine with optional React
hooks, and a demo web app. It is early and moving fast - read its README before
planning around it.

### Build Privacy Wallets

The Build Privacy Wallets section is the lower-level SDK route for teams building
**privacy wallets on Starknet**, account-controlled backends, and advanced
integrators. Use it when you need to
manage registration, channels, note discovery, transaction construction, and
proving providers yourself. See [Build Privacy Wallets](/sdk/getting-started).

### Shadow accounts

Shadow accounts are persistent, pseudonymous identities for account-based app
activity. Each `(user, dapp, nonce)` tuple maps to a deterministic address with
no public onchain link to the user's main wallet.

Both integration routes are available. Dapps can send
`shadow_account_invoke` through Wallet API `0.10.4` with starknet.js `10.8.0`;
wallets and advanced backends can use Privacy SDK `0.14.3-rc.8` through
`transfers.build().shadowAccounts(dappName)`. See
[Shadow Accounts through the Wallet API](/starknet-wallet-api/shadow-accounts)
or [Shadow Accounts with the Privacy SDK](/sdk/shadow-accounts).

The shadow address, balances, calls, and positions are public. What stays
private is the link back to the user's main wallet. A shadow account has no
keys; only the `ShadowAccountAnonymizer` can execute through it.

### Prover backend

Most dapps do not need to operate proving infrastructure. Wallets,
infrastructure teams, and advanced integrators may run their own prover when
they need operational control over proof generation. Deposit screening applies
regardless of proving route: FPI screens shielding addresses and signs each
deposit, and the pool verifies the signature onchain, so a self-hosted prover
meets the same deposit-screening requirement as hosted services.

## Builder rules of thumb

- Use the Starknet Wallet API first for user-facing private dapps.
- Use Build Privacy Wallets when you are building the wallet itself or need low-level SDK control.
- Do not ask a normal dapp user for their viewing key.
- For private DeFi integrations, expect both a Starknet Wallet API flow and an app-specific anonymizer contract.
- Deposits are screened on every route - self-hosted proving does not bypass onchain screening.
- Be explicit about what remains public: deposits, withdrawals, timing, and some app-side activity may still be visible.
- Verify wallet support, API versions, contract addresses, and compliance assumptions before launch.
