Anonymizer contracts (also called **helper contracts**) are how private funds
interact with the outside world - DEXs, lending vaults, escrows - without
revealing who is behind the interaction.

The pattern is a sandwich, executed atomically in one transaction:

```
withdraw from pool  →  helper does something  →  deposit result to an open note
```

1. The pool **withdraws** input tokens to the helper (a plain public transfer -
   observers see the pool paid the helper, not who initiated it).
2. The pool calls the helper's `privacy_invoke` entry point via the protocol's
   `INVOKE_SELECTOR`.
3. The helper does its work, approves the pool to pull the output tokens, and
   **returns a `Span<OpenNoteDeposit>`** - instructions telling the pool which
   open notes to credit with which tokens and amounts.

The output lands in an **open note**: its amount is public (it was measured
on-chain, so it could not be fixed at proof time), but its owner is still hidden.

## The contract every helper must satisfy

The pool deserializes your calldata into `privacy_invoke`'s parameters - you are
free to design the signature after the first `operation`-style arguments - and it
deserializes your return value as `Span<OpenNoteDeposit>`:

```cairo
/// From privacy::objects
pub struct OpenNoteDeposit {
    /// The identifier of the open note to deposit to.
    pub note_id: felt252,
    /// The ERC20 token contract to deposit.
    pub token: ContractAddress,
    /// The amount of tokens to deposit.
    pub amount: u128,
}
```

Here is the smallest possible helper - it simply echoes the deposit instructions
it is given back to the pool:

```cairo
{{{EchoHelper}}}
```

Useless in production, but it shows the full contract surface: one entry point,
calldata in, `Span<OpenNoteDeposit>` out.

## Rules of the pattern

- **Return exactly a `Span<OpenNoteDeposit>`** - returning anything else (or
  trailing garbage) makes the pool reject the call.
- **Approve, don't transfer** - the helper approves the pool to pull the output;
  the pool executes the pull itself when applying the deposits.
- **An empty span is valid** - it means "credit nothing" (the escrow's Deposit
  operation uses this: funds stay parked in the helper).
- **Measure output by balance delta** - real helpers record the output token
  balance before and after the external call, so the credited amount is exactly
  what arrived, whatever the external protocol did.
- **One `invoke` per transaction** - the protocol allows at most one external
  invoke per pool transaction.

The next two pages build real helpers on this skeleton: a DEX swap and a Vesu
lending integration.
