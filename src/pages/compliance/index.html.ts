const html = `<p>STRK20 is private from the public, not from lawful oversight. Compliance rests
on two mechanisms: every deposit is screened before it enters the pool, and
selective disclosure is available after the fact through a single ciphertext
created at registration.</p>
<h2>Onchain deposit screening</h2>
<p>Every deposit into the pool is screened. FPI (the screening provider) screens
the address that shields tokens and signs every deposit; the pool verifies
FPI&#39;s signature onchain before accepting the deposit. Since the v0.14.3
upgrade this enforcement lives in the protocol itself, so it applies on every
route into the pool - wallet flows, SDK integrations, and self-hosted provers
alike. Running your own prover is not a way around screening: any other pool
action can be proven with any prover, but a deposit without a valid screening
signature is rejected onchain.</p>
<h2>The escrowed viewing key</h2>
<p>When a user registers (<code>SetViewingKey</code>), their <strong>private viewing key is
encrypted to the auditor&#39;s public key</strong> - using the same ephemeral ECDH scheme
as channels - and stored on-chain. The auditor&#39;s public key is set by
governance, and the scheme supports <strong>threshold keys</strong>, so decryption need
not rest with a single party.</p>
<p>Disclosure is <strong>selective</strong>: the auditor decrypts only the viewing keys of
users subject to a lawful request. Everyone else&#39;s transaction graph stays
encrypted - there is no bulk-surveillance mode.</p>
<h2>What a recovered viewing key reveals</h2>
<p>With one user&#39;s private viewing key, an auditor can:</p>
<ul>
<li>open all their <strong>incoming channels</strong> - who paid them, how much, which token</li>
<li>open all their <strong>outgoing channels</strong> - whom they paid</li>
<li>decrypt every note amount and match published nullifiers to spent notes</li>
<li>follow funds <strong>forward</strong> (deposit → notes → further transfers → withdrawals)
and <strong>backward</strong> (withdrawal → notes → originating deposits)</li>
</ul>
<h2>What stays visible on-chain for everyone</h2>

<h2>Auditors cannot spend</h2>
<p>A viewing key is exactly that - a <em>viewing</em> key. Spending requires a valid
account signature verified inside the proof, and the auditor has no
transaction authority. Compromise of the auditor key would break
confidentiality, never custody.</p>
<h2>Known privacy limitations</h2>
<p>Honest accounting of what the protocol does not hide:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Channel-open linkability</strong> - opening a channel and depositing or
withdrawing in the same transaction (or in tight succession) can link a
recipient to their public activity. Spread setup and movement over time.</li>
<li><strong>Distinctive patterns</strong> - recognizable amounts, or rapid in-and-out
sequences between deposit and withdrawal, weaken the anonymity set. This
affects every privacy pool design.</li>
<li><strong>Edges are public by design</strong> - deposits and withdrawals expose addresses
and amounts; only movement <em>inside</em> the pool is encrypted.</li>
</ul>
<p>With the full concept set in hand, revisit <a href="/what-is-strk20">What is STRK20?</a>
