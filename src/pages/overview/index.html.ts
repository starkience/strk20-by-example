const html = `<p>Here&#39;s everything about getting started with building private applications.</p>
<p>Starknet privacy has a small set of builder surfaces. Start with the highest-level
route that fits your product, and only move lower when you need more control.</p>

<h2>Core pieces</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>STRK20 Pool:</strong> the live Starknet mainnet pool that holds ERC-20s as encrypted
notes and enables shielded balances, private transfers, and private DeFi.</li>
<li><strong>Starknet Wallet API / starknet.js:</strong> the standard route for private dapps. The
app asks the wallet to act; the wallet manages viewing keys, notes, proofs, and
signatures.</li>
<li><strong>Anonymizer contracts:</strong> app-specific <code>privacy_invoke</code> adapters for DeFi. The pool
calls the helper atomically, then credits the result back into private notes.</li>
<li><strong>Privacy SDK:</strong> the low-level route for wallets and advanced integrations that
need direct control over registration, channels, note discovery, and proving.</li>
<li><strong>Private sub-accounts (coming soon):</strong> an advanced account-privacy route for hiding the public
link between a user&#39;s main wallet and app activity.</li>
<li><strong>Prover backend:</strong> infrastructure for teams that need to operate their own proof
generation.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What stays visible</h2>
<p>Inside the pool, sender, receiver, token, amount, and spent notes are private.
Deposits, withdrawals, timing, and some app-side activity may still be public.</p>
