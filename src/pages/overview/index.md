Here's everything about getting started with building private applications.

Starknet privacy has a small set of builder surfaces. Start with the highest-level
route that fits your product, and only move lower when you need more control.

## Choose your integration route

## Core pieces

- **STRK20 Pool:** the live Starknet mainnet pool that holds ERC-20s as encrypted
  notes and enables shielded balances, private transfers, and private DeFi.
- **Starknet Wallet API / starknet.js:** the standard route for private dapps. The
  app asks the wallet to act; the wallet manages viewing keys, notes, proofs, and
  signatures.
- **Anonymizer contracts:** app-specific `privacy_invoke` adapters for DeFi. The pool
  calls the helper atomically, then credits the result back into private notes.
- **Privacy SDK:** the low-level route for wallets and advanced integrations that
  need direct control over registration, channels, note discovery, and proving.
- **Private sub-accounts (coming soon):** an advanced account-privacy route for hiding the public
  link between a user's main wallet and app activity.
- **Prover backend:** infrastructure for teams that need to operate their own proof
  generation.

## What stays visible

Inside the pool, sender, receiver, token, amount, and spent notes are private.
Deposits, withdrawals, timing, and some app-side activity may still be public.
