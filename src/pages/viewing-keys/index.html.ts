<p><code>K = k·G</code> on the STARK curve. The public key is <strong>registered once</strong> via the
<code>SetViewingKey</code> action and treated as immutable - every channel ever opened to
you is derived from it, so it cannot change without breaking discovery.</p>
<h2 id="symmetric-masking">Symmetric masking</h2>
<p>Inside a channel, data is hidden with cheap "hash-and-add" masking rather than
heavyweight ciphers. Each field gets its own <strong>domain-separated Poseidon hash</strong>
plus a per-use <strong>salt</strong>, so no mask is ever reused:</p>
<pre><code>enc_amount = (h(ENC_AMOUNT_TAG, channel_key, token, index, 0, salt) + amount) mod 2^128
enc_token  =  h(ENC_TOKEN_TAG,  channel_key, index, 0, salt) + token
</code></pre><p>Anyone holding the channel key recomputes the mask and subtracts it off.
Anyone without it sees values indistinguishable from random field elements.
The domain tags (<code>ENC_AMOUNT_TAG:V1</code>, <code>ENC_TOKEN_TAG:V1</code>, …) guarantee that a
mask derived for one purpose can never be replayed in another context.</p>
<h2 id="asymmetric-encryption-ecdh-with-ephemeral-keys">Asymmetric encryption: ECDH with ephemeral keys</h2>
<p>Symmetric masking needs a shared secret - the channel key. Establishing it uses
<strong>ECDH on the STARK curve</strong> with a fresh ephemeral key per channel:</p>
<pre><code>sender picks random r
publishes   rG            (ephemeral public key)
computes    shared = r·K  (recipient&#x27;s public viewing key)

enc_channel_key = h(ENC_CHANNEL_KEY_TAG, shared.x) + channel_key
enc_sender_addr = h(ENC_SENDER_ADDR_TAG, shared.x) + sender_addr
</code></pre><p>The recipient computes the same secret from the other side: <code>k·(rG) = r·K</code>.
An observer sees only <code>rG</code> and two masked values - they learn that <em>a</em> channel
was opened, not by whom or to whom.</p>
<h2 id="the-auditor-copy">The auditor copy</h2>
<p>At registration, the user&#39;s private viewing key <code>k</code> is also encrypted - with
the same ephemeral ECDH pattern - to the <strong>auditor&#39;s public key</strong> and stored
on-chain. This single escrowed ciphertext is what enables compliance: an
auditor under lawful process can recover <code>k</code> and decrypt that user&#39;s history,
while everyone else&#39;s data stays private. See
<a href="/compliance">Compliance &amp; Auditing</a>.</p>
<h2 id="why-open-notes-skip-masking">Why open notes skip masking</h2>
<p>An <strong>open note</strong> carries its amount in plaintext, using the protocol-reserved
salt. This is deliberate: when a DeFi interaction (say, an AMM swap) produces
an output amount that is only known at execution time, the client cannot mask
it in advance - the mask is part of the proven transaction, but the amount
isn&#39;t decided until the anonymizer contract runs on-chain. Open notes trade amount
privacy for that late binding; ownership and subsequent spends remain private.</p>
<h2 id="rule-of-thumb">Rule of thumb</h2>
<ul>
<li>Everything derivable from <code>k</code> + public on-chain data → readable by you.</li>
<li>Everything else → opaque Poseidon outputs and masked field elements.</li>
</ul>
